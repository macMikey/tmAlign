USE:
Use tmAlign3 to help lay out controls in stacks: buttons, graphics, images, fields, etc.  tmAlign3 provides the following functions:

> Alignment -- align controls to each other or to the card on which they appear.

> Distribution -- space objects apart evenly based on the space they occupy, or the dimensions of the card on which they appear. 

> Contact & Space -- fit multiple objects together objects side-by-side, or separate them with a defined amount of space.

> Equalization -- match object dimensions, making their widths and/or heights equal.

> Justification -- align the selected edges of objects, resizing them as needed, without moving them.

Object positioning can be applied based on the space occupied by the objects, or base on the dimensions of the card.  You can also position objects based on the first object selected. 

Use the undo button to revert your last action.

The tmAlign3 palette can be collapsed without closing it to save space on your desktop.
